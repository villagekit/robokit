# Robo Kit ðŸ¤–

## About

Firmware for simple robotic automation.

The short-term goal is to build [an automated machine for grid beam production](https://wiki.villagekit.com/en/grid-bot/concepts).

The long-term goal is to provide a [real-time interrupt-driven](https://rtic.rs) [actor-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) foundation for robotic automation or CNC machine control.

## Status

Under active development, but probably not useful to anyone.

If you're here and like what's happening, please say hi! ðŸ‘‹
